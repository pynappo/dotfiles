Here's my neovim config that I might link on Reddit posts and stuff. Some cool things of note:

* [keymaps.lua](./lua/pynappo/keymaps.lua) holds all keymaps in one file for easy searching.
* indent-blankline is given cool but subtle rainbow indent lines.
* Tries to be as up to date with newest nvim features as possible.
* 103 plugins using lazy.nvim.
