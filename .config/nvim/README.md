Here's my neovim config that I might link on Reddit posts and stuff. Some cool things of note:

* [keymaps.lua](./lua/pynappo/keymaps.lua) holds all keymaps in one file for easy searching.
* <200ms startuptime on windows
* indent-blankline is given cool but subtle rainbow indent lines.
* Tries to be up to date.
* 119 plugins using lazy.nvim.
* A self-made modes.nvim rip-off that relies on heirline mode colors (see [autocmds.lua](./lua/pynappo/autocmds.lua))
