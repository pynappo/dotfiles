# Better Status Indicators
A Powercord plug-in that provides enhanced functionality and personalization to statuses.

## Detailed Summary
Ever wondered why that one particular friend of yours is still lurking around on Discord even after you've told them to go to sleep?... And you just wished there was some way to see if they're actually in bed and not secretly on their mobile phone despite their status not being explicitly set to "online" (i.e. "idle" or "do not disturb")?...

Perhaps you also like to let off some steam by unnecessarily picking on someone just because they're one of "those people" that still use Discord in a web browser?... Or do you miss the days when Discord had the old status indicators instead of the new ones that we have today?...

Whatever the case may be, "Better Status Indicators" has got you covered. Featuring:
- Mobile status indicators for every status type (excluding "offline")
- Shiny new status indicators, showing whether or not a user is using Discord on the web or in desktop.
- Configurable status indicators (i.e. change them to a solid circle or revert them to the old color-blind mode)

As well as plenty more other features that are ready to explore and still planned.

And before you ask - yes, it is fully compatible with Radial Status. It should also work with other plug-ins and themes. Please let me know if it doesn't! :)
